# Blue Web

Blue Web is the base library for [Blue React](https://bruegmann.github.io/blue-react) and [Blue Blazor](https://bruegmann.github.io/blue-react). This library builds heavily on top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) and also provides additional solutions in CSS and JavaScript.

## Use Blue Web

Install with NPM:

```
npm i blue-web
```

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/blue-web)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blue-web)

## Implementation

If you have a React or Blazor project, you should use the components of [Blue React](https://bruegmann.github.io/blue-react) or [Blue Blazor](https://bruegmann.github.io/blue-blazor). Otherwise you can also write the markup of those components directly in HTML. Check out the examples in the docs to find out how.

For the JavaScript solutions you have to import the associated file. When installed using NPM, you can do it like this:

```js
import "blue-web/dist/js/dialog.js"
import "blue-web/dist/js/progress.js"
// ...
```

You can also use a CDN like unpkg.com. Only recommended for testing, not for production.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/blue-web@latest/dist/js/dialog.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/blue-web@latest/dist/js/progress.js"></script>
<!-- ... -->
```

## Customization and theming

Since Blue Web is based on Bootstrap, you can customize many things by overriding Sass or CSS variables. For more information, see the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/overview/). Blue Web also provides some additional variables that you can use and override. Take a look at [dist/styles/\_variables.scss](https://github.com/bruegmann/blue-web/blob/main/dist/styles/_variables.scss) to see all of them.

Here is an example of how to override variables using Sass:

```scss
// Override Bootstrap Sass variable
$primary: tomato;

// Override Blue Web Sass variables
$theme: orange;
$theme-dark: darken(orange, 10%);

// Stylesheet for Blue Web. Already contains Bootstrap.
@import "~blue-web/dist/style";
```

An example of how to override CSS variables:

```css
:root {
    /* Override Bootstrap CSS variable */
    --bs-body-font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;

    /* Override Blue Web CSS variable */
    --blue-sidebar-bg: #333;
}
```
