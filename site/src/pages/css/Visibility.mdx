# Visibility

## `.blue-opacity-hover`, `.blue-opacity-hover-content-active`, `.blue-opacity-hover-content-default`

With `.blue-opacity-hover` you can hide things by default and let them appear when the user hovers the area around it or focuses an element inside.
This way you can simplify the UI a bit and make controls disappear when they are not needed. On touch screens the elements will always be visible.
Usage:

```html use:RenderBlock
<div class="card blue-opacity-hover p-3 flex-row justify-content-between">
    <h5 class="blue-opacity-hover-content-default">Hover here to see a button</h5>
    <input type="text" class="form-control me-1" placeholder="When you focus me, the button should appear too" />
    <button class="btn btn-secondary blue-opacity-hover-content-active">Hey there</button>
</div>
```

## `.blue-d-hover`, `.blue-d-hover-content-active`, `.blue-d-hover-content-default`

`.blue-d-hover` is similar to `.blue-opacity-hover`, but the elements will disappear and appear with the `display` property.
It is ideal if you want to replace something with something else when the user hovers. On the example I used it to change the edit and delete icons from lineout to filled when hovering.
Usage:

```html use:RenderBlock
<button class="btn btn-secondary blue-d-hover d-inline-flex align-items-center gap-1">
    <span class="blue-d-hover-content-default">â­•</span>
    <span class="blue-d-hover-content-active">ðŸ”µ</span>
    Hover to fill the icon
</button>
```
