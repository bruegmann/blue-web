# Text and Icons

## `.blue-page-header` or `.page-header`

In previous versions of Bootstrap, `.page-header` was a class that could be used to add a border to the bottom of a page header.
Unfortunately his class was removed in Bootstrap 5, so it's now part of Blue Web CSS.

```html use:RenderBlock
<div class="border rounded p-3">
    <div class="h1 blue-page-header">Example headline</div>
</div>
```

## `.blue-icon` or `.bi`

Vertically alignment, especially for Bootstrap Icons.
