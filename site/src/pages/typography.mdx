# Typography

Since Blue Web builds on top of Bootstrap, you should also check out [their section about typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/typography/).

## Inter as font family

Blue Web is configured to use [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) with some preset font features. The required font files aren't included with Blue Web.
[Please take a look at the documentation by Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter?tab=readme-ov-file#using--installing-inter) to find out how to install them.

As fallback, when Inter couldn't be loaded, the default font family setting by Bootstrap (`$font-family-sans-serif`) will be used, which is a native font stack that selects the best font-family for each OS and device.
